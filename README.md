# Blinkande julgran (Blinking Christmas Tree)
This is a program for a blinking Christmas tree coded onto an ATmega88 microchip. The Christmas tree offers a few light pattern variations, controlled by a variator.

I built this Christmas tree for a friend of mine. She later discovered a bug relating to switching between light patterns. Unfortunately, I couldn't fix it for her, because my design didn't include a USB port and I didn't want to tear apart the whole tree to get to the microchip. A lesson learned, to always design a way to update the code. It was so long ago she discovered the bug so I don't remember how to reproduce it.
